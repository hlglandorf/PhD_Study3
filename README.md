# PhD_Study3
This repository holds R code from my third PhD study that explores the relationship between athlete burnout, stress, and a number of acute and chronic biomarkers (blood pressure, heart rate variability, cortisol from saliva and hair, testosterone, DHEA-S, CRP, sIgA, blood lipids, glycated haemoglobin, DNA methylation in three genes). Part A of this study explore acute biomarkers with dynamic regression models and visual analyses, while Part B explores chronic biomarkers with visual analyses only. 

This study is currently under peer-review and thus code may change. Since this is a case study design, data is not publically available.

The pre-registration for this study (Glandorf, 2022) can be found on psycharchives: https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.6531
